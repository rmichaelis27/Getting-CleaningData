# Getting-CleaningData
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Final Project

This script will take in multiple data sets and merge them together. Then a subset of the merged data will be created with means and standard deviations of each observation. There are comments included line by line to see how exactly each piece is working to create the tidy data set.
